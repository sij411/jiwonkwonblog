## Sweet or Salty?

Absolutely, Sweet! There is no debate in here. The dearest friends of tea, biscuit and cakes.
Biscuits... malted milk and digestive are the best choice for dunking. Now I crave them ooops.
Cakes... carrot cake, cheese cake, chocolate cake, and victoria cake. Cakes are just perfect.

Coffee works too, but you don't want to drink heavy caffeinated drinks as many as coffee, do you?
You know what? There is a old lady who died because she drank 150 tea bags a day. I thought it was a bad joke, but it's true.
